# (Unofficial) Ember template lint for VS Code

See ember-template-lint errors in your Problems view and editor as you work with `.hbs` files in your Ember project.

## Requirements

Your Ember project needs to already use ember-template-lint as a dependency. It needs to be in node_modules.

You also need a `.template-lintrc.js` file in your project root. Without that, this extension will not activate.
