# (Unofficial) Ember template lint for VS Code

See ember-template-lint errors in your Problems view as you edit `.hbs` files in your Ember project.

In your editor view, each error should show a red squiggly.

## Requirements

Your Ember project must:

- Use ember-template-lint@^2.3.0 as a dependency (with it installed in node_modules).
- Have a `.template-lintrc.js` file in your project root (same directory as package.json and node_modules).
Without it, this extension will not activate.
